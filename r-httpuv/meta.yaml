  summary: Provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling HTTP and WebSocket requests
    directly from within R. It is primarily intended as a building block for other packages,
    rather than making it particularly easy to create complete web applications using
    httpuv alone. httpuv is built on top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both
    of which were developed by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser
    license information.)
